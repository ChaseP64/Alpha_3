"""singleton.py
Utility module providing a trivial *Singleton* base‑class that can be inherited
by services requiring a single application‑wide instance.

The implementation is intentionally lightweight – only one instance per Python
process.  Classes inheriting from :class:`Singleton` **must** implement their
own *idempotent* ``__init__`` (guarding against re‑initialisation) if they hold
state initialisation that should run once.
